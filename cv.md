## Employment History ##

### October 2010 - Present: Systems Architect for TagMan 


### March 2008 – October 2010: Senior Systems Administrator for Ominor

At Ominor I set up and maintained 30+ servers for a range of e-commerce
websites developed in PHP and Ruby on Rails, spread across two data centres
in several environments. One of my major tasks was to provision a new rack
for a client with a turnover of approximately one million pounds a month. I
managed the servers with Puppet, and used Nagios and Munin to monitor the
servers and collect usage data.

Throughout my time at Ominor I worked closely with the developers as part
of a team following an Agile methodology. As part of this I helped maintain
the continuous integration servers, and performed deploys as and when they
were signed off by the clients.


### January 2008 – March 2008: Contract Systems Administrator for Fotango

During the windup of Fotango, I worked as a contractor providing out-of-
hours cover and daytime support while the Fotango systems were transitioned
to their new provider.

### January 2006 – December 2007: Senior Systems Administrator for Fotango

At Fotango I was a member of a five-person team providing support for about
200 RedHat and Debian machines in our production, staging, development and
office environments.

One of my first tasks was to design and install a rack for a new product,
including redundant routers, load balancers, web servers and database
servers. The routers used VRRP for failover, and the load balancers used a
combination of Heartbeat, ldirectord and IPVS to provide high-availability
web services. The database cluster ran PostgreSQL, and used DRBD and
Heartbeat to provide a failover solution. I also set up monitoring and
logging for this product using Nagios and syslog-ng. The web servers were
organized as Xen guest domains spread across a cluster of machines.

I was also responsible, along with a co-worker, for investigating
alternative technologies for automatic provisioning of machines, to replace
the existing system based on cfengine and a custom autoinstaller. Much of
our testing involved virtualization using Xen and VMware. Our eventual
choice was a combination of Puppet and FAI.

As well as projects such as these, I was part of the on-call rota providing
support for our legacy systems, including our IBM SAN and several large
MySQL databases.

### August 2002 - December 2005: Senior Systems Administrator for Glu Mobile

While at Glu Mobile I installed and  maintained  over  twenty  internal  and
external systems which provided numerous services.  My  main  duty  was  the
administration of six Sun machines (3x280R, 3xv100)  running  Solaris  which
acted as a provisioning system for mobile games using  Jboss  and  MySQL.  I
also administered machines running other services such as mail,  DNS,  samba
for internal  file  shares,  Checkpoint  FW-1/VPN-1,  HTTP  (both  barebones
Apache/PHP  and  Jboss/Jetty  solutions)   and   DHCP.   I   installed   and
administered a new backup system using Veritas NetBackup 4.5 and a  Sun  L8,
and initiated the process of migrating to Veritas NetBackup 6.0 with  a  Sun
L100.  For most of my time  at  Glu  I  was  also  responsible  for  desktop
support.

### August 2000 - June 2002: Systems Administrator for Profero

At Profero I was responsible for the administration of  several  Intel-based
machines running FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Suse Linux.  These  machines  provided
services such as mail, DNS and file sharing using  samba  and  appletalk.  I
also administered  the  machines  that  Profero's  ad  servers  ran  on.  In
conjunction with this I set up and maintained a firewall  (StoneGate)  which
provided load balancing and clustering.

### June 2000 - July 2000: Fixed-term contract to provide support and systems administration for Sciteb

While contracting for Sciteb I installed a number of desktops (Linux and
Windows) and set up several services on their Linux server.

### August 1999 - June 2000: Systems Administrator and Software Developer for Pepper Head Design

I joined Pepper Head Design as an HTML coder and progressed to become a  PHP
and JSP developer leading a team of two other  developers.  I  also  liaised
with our outsourced Java developers, and  was  responsible  for  support  of
desktops and servers running a combination of Linux, OS/2 and Windows.
